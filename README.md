# Introduction 
This is a my Blog based on responsive design;
For suiting the different screen size, using the grid layout to change its size automatically;
In home page, for a better expansibility, I chosed the iframe module for different pages' content.
And in notes' page, this is just a single page using the innerHTML change the article part. In order to focus on the notes itself, all my notes are recorded in markdown files. I combine the *XHL* and *marked.js* to dispaly md files.  
Although there may be some problem in extreme situation, it could run well in normal facilities.
