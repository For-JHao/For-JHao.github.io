# Introduction 
This is my Blog project for recording my notes.</br>
There are two main parts: **Welcome** and **Notes**.</br>
The development follows the semantic standards of HTML5, combining grid layout and media queries to support responsive layout. In order to focus on the notes itself, all the notes are recorded in markdown files, instead of writing on web immediatly. </br>
The support of responsive layout is still not perfect (keep working).</br>
