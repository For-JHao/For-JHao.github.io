# introduction 
This is a simple Blog templete based on responsive design;
For suiting the different screen size, using the grid layout to change its size automatically;
I want to realise a single page application just with the html and javascript , therefore I chosed the iframe module for different pages' content.  
Although there may be some problem in extreme situation, it could run well in normal facilities.
