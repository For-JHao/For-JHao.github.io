# Introduction 
This is my Blog project for recording my notes.</br>

There are two projects for it.

## vite-react
This is the newer one for reconstructing old version with react. </br>
react + vite + ant design + tsparticles
</br>
Improvemets: </br>
Read markdown fileList and render menu automatically now by node script. </br>
Component-based development, use-friendly with react and Ant design.  </br>
Optimise package with vite, re-use all the notes markdown and convert them by marked.js. </br>
Use github action to auto build and deploy following branches main&vite-react. </br>

## static file（old version）
There are two main parts: **Welcome** and **Notes**.</br>
The development follows the semantic standards of HTML5, combining grid layout and media queries to support responsive layout. In order to focus on the notes itself, all the notes are recorded in markdown files, instead of writing on web immediatly. </br>
The support of responsive layout is still not perfect (keep working).</br>
